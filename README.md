# Full-Stack Application: Frontend and Backend

This project consists of a frontend React application and a backend Spring Boot application using Java 17 with MongoDB for data storage.

## Frontend Application

### Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application:

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harish3000/React-Springboot-Practicals
   cd <repository-folder>/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```text
   http://localhost:5173/
   ```

### Using the Application

- **Home Page**: Displays a list of posts. Click on a post card to view its details.
- **Details Page**: Shows details of a selected post, including comments. You can add new comments here.
- **Create Post Modal**: Accessible from the Home Page, allows you to create a new post with a title, description, and color.

### Backend API Integration

- The frontend application interacts with the backend API for managing posts and comments. Ensure the backend is running to enable full functionality.

## Backend Application (Spring Boot)

### Getting Started

To get started with the backend application:

#### Prerequisites

- Java 17 installed on your machine.
- MongoDB installed and running locally or accessible via a MongoDB server.

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harish3000/React-Springboot-Practicals
   cd <repository-folder>/backend
   ```

2. Ensure MongoDB is running.

#### Running the Application

1. Build the application:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean package
   ```

2. Run the Spring Boot application:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/<backend-jar-file>.jar
   ```

   Replace `<backend-jar-file>` with the actual JAR file generated by Maven.

3. The backend will start running at:

   ```text
   http://localhost:8080/
   ```

### Backend API Details

- **Create Post**: Sends a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/api/posts` with JSON body `{ "title": "Title", "description": "Description", "color": "Color" }`.
- **Add Comment**: Sends a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/api/comments` with JSON body `{ "postId": postId, "description": "Comment" }`.
- **Fetch Posts**: Retrieves all posts from `http://localhost:8080/api/posts`.
- **Fetch Comments**: Retrieves comments for a post from `http://localhost:8080/api/comments?postId=postId`.
- **Get Number of Comments**: Retrieves the number of comments for a post from `http://localhost:8080/api/posts/{postId}/comments/count`.
